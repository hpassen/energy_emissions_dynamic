      <h1>Energy and Emissions in America</h1> 
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Energy generation has changed significantly over the past thirty years. Fossil fuels face a public relations disaster because the carbon dioxide emissions they produce are driving catatrophic global climate change. Meanwhile, renewable energy sources like solar and wind power have been been hailed as a way to meet the energy needs of the future in a sustainable ways. 
      </p>
      <p> The energy story of the past three decades does demonstrated a sustained move way from the worst pollutants. But rhetoric aside, the United States requires much more sustained investment in renewable sources before these power sources can full substitute for fossil fuels.

          <p>In 1990 The US energy landscape was dominated by coal, which generated over 1.5 billion megawatt hours of power.</p>
          <p>Nuclear energy, the second largest source of energy, generated less than half the power generated by coal.</p>
          <p>Hydroelectric and geothermal power contributed modestly to the power landscape, while solar and wind power were almost non-existent.</p>

        <div class="step" data-step="2">
          <p>By 2019, the energy landscape had shifted dramatically. </p>
          <p> Natural gas power more than tripled, generating as much energy as coal in 1990, while coal power decreased by over a third.</p>
          <p> Wind and solar power also appear non-trivially in the landscape.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step" data-step="3">
          <p>While coal generation decreased, its decline was far from steady.</p>
          <p>Instead, coal energy generation climbed through the mid 2000s, then fell to less than half its peak of over 4 billion megawatt hours generated.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step" data-step="4">
          <p>By contrast, power generation by petroleum was more volatile through the mid 2000s, with significant peaks and valleys averaging around 100 million megawatt hours.</p>
          <p>However, by 2019 petroleum was generating only 1/6 of its 1990 amount of power.

        <div class="step" data-step="5">
          <p>Natural gas is the energy source that grew the most over the past three decades.</p>
          <p>Gas has grown steadily, almost quadrupling its 1990 production of about 400 million megawatt hours to generate nearly 1.6 billion megawatt hours of energy in 2019.</p>

          <p>Nuclear energy, which is frequently classified as a renewable source of energy but comes with other XXX grew modestly over the past 30 years</p>

          <p>The largest increase in renewable power comes from wind energy, which grew over 3x</p>

        <h2>Explore Energy Generation in America</h2>
        <p>
          Perhaps predictably, in America, the conversation about pollution and power is deeply politicized: democrats push for stronger regulations on carbon emissions and bans on oil exploration, while republicans claim that a move away from fossil fuels will cause catatrophic economic consequences. Federal administrations from opposing parties take turns undoing each othersâ€™ executive orders, and the polarization in Congress makes legislation unlikely. Given the consequences of continued deadlock and inaction - more frequent and more devastating natural disasters, species extinction, displacement, health impacts - is there a path towards a more renewable future that can pass political muster?
        </p>
        <p>
          Based on trends in power generation in America, renewable energy is a bipartisan policy reality. States increased their green energy generation almost uniformly, and began to move away from the worst pollutants. However, the growth in renewable energy generation has not meant universal decreases in emissions. Many states that have increased their renewable generation have also increased their nonrenewable generation - and their emissions along with it. Yet Rust Belt states along the Great Lakes are showing the largest descrease in emissions, and the growth in emissions has slowed in high non-renewable production states like Texas.
