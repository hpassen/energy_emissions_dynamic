        <h1>Energy in America</h1> 
        <h4>by Hana Passen</h4>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Energy generation has changed significantly over the past thirty years. Fossil fuels face a public relations disaster because the carbon dioxide emissions they produce are driving catatrophic global climate change. Meanwhile, renewable energy sources like solar and wind power have been been hailed as a way to meet the energy needs of the future in a sustainable ways. 
        </p>
        <p> The energy story of the past three decades does demonstrated a sustained move way from the worst pollutants. But rhetoric aside, the United States requires much more sustained investment in renewable energy before these power sources can fully substitute for fossil fuels.

        <div class="step" data-step="1" class="is-active">
          <p>In 1990 The US energy landscape was dominated by coal, which generated over 1.5 billion megawatt hours of power.</p>
          <p>Nuclear energy, the second largest source of energy, generated less than half the power generated by coal.</p>
          <p>Hydroelectric and geothermal power contributed modestly to the power landscape, while solar and wind power were almost non-existent.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step" data-step="2">
          <p>By 2019, the energy landscape had shifted dramatically. </p>
          <p> Natural gas power more than tripled, generating as much energy as coal in 1990, while coal power decreased by over a third.</p>
          <p> Wind and solar power also appear non-trivially in the landscape.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step" data-step="3">
          <p>While coal generation decreased, its decline was far from steady.</p>
          <p>Instead, coal energy generation climbed through the mid 2000s, then fell to less than half its peak of over 2 billion megawatt hours generated.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step" data-step="4">
          <p>By contrast, power generation by petroleum was more volatile through the mid 2000s, with significant peaks and valleys around an average of approximately 100 million megawatt hours.</p>
          <p>However, by 2019, petroleum was generating only one sixth of its 1990 amount of energy. 
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="step" data-step="5">
          <p>Natural gas showed the greatest increase over the past three decades.</p>
          <p>Its growth has been steady - gas almost quadrupled its 1990 production of about 400 million megawatt hours, generating nearly 1.6 billion megawatt hours of energy in 2019.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step" data-step="6">
          <p>Geothermal and hydroelectric power have held fairly constant since 1990.</p>
          <p>While the United States has experienced volatility in hydroelectric power generation, with a nearly 200 million megawatt hour swing between its highest and lowest points, the average has remained steady, around 300 million megawatt hours of total generation.</p>
          <p>Geothermal energy, meanwhile, has remained both modest and stable since 1990. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="step" data-step="7">
          <p>Nuclear energy, which is classified as a renewable source of energy, but comes with safety and waste management concerns, grew modestly over the past 30 years, adding a third to its 1990 levels.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step" data-step="8">
          <p>The largest increase in renewable power comes from wind energy.</p>
          <p>From near non-existence in 1990, wind power grew slowly through the mid 2000s, when it picked up momentum.</p>
          <p>Once wind power started to grow, it grew quickly - in the last 15 years, wind power generation increased by over a factor of 10.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step" data-step="9">
          <p>Solar power was delayed even longer than wind.</p>
          <p>It was near-zero through the early 2010s, before picking up quickly in the last decade.</p>
          <p>By 2019, solar power generation had reached nearly 70 million megawatt hours - and growth does not appear to be slowing.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step" data-step="10">
          <p>However, wind and solar both require much greater investment to begin generating power at the levels of the 'dirtier' power sources: coal, gas, and nuclear.</p>
          <p>Wind power, by 2019, had only just overtaken hydroelectric power, while solar power still makes up a small share of total energy generation.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step" data-step="11">
          <p>Power generation in the United States has been characterized by a persistant growth in renewables, which have nearly doubled since 1990.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step" data-step="12">
          <p>However, the final picture is mixed.</p>
          <p>Mostly due to the massive growth in natural gas generation, non-renewable energy has also grown during the same time period.</p>
          <p>It is promising, however, that while renewable energy is trending upwards, nonrenewable energy has been trending downwards since the late 2000s.</p>
          <p>If this trend continues, we may yet reach a future in which renewable sources of power generate more of our energy than nonrenewables.</p>

        <h2>Explore Energy Generation in America</h2>
        <p>
          Perhaps predictably, in America, the conversation about pollution and power is deeply politicized: democrats push for stronger regulations on carbon emissions and bans on oil exploration, while republicans claim that a move away from fossil fuels will cause catatrophic economic consequences. Federal administrations from opposing parties take turns undoing each othersâ€™ executive orders, and the polarization in Congress makes legislation unlikely. Given the consequences of continued deadlock and inaction - more frequent and more devastating natural disasters, species extinction, displacement, health impacts - is there a path towards a more renewable future that can pass political muster?
        </p>
        <p>
          Based on trends in power generation in America, renewable energy is a bipartisan policy reality. States increased their green energy generation almost uniformly, and began to move away from the worst pollutants. However, the growth in renewable energy generation has not meant universal decreases in emissions. Many states that have increased their renewable generation have also increased their nonrenewable generation - and their emissions along with it. Yet Rust Belt states along the Great Lakes are showing the largest descrease in emissions, and the growth in emissions has slowed in high non-renewable production states like Texas.
