        <h1>Energy in America</h1> 
        <h4>by Hana Passen</h4>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Energy generation has changed significantly over the past thirty years. Fossil fuels face a public relations disaster because the carbon dioxide emissions they produce are driving catatrophic global climate change. Meanwhile, renewable energy sources like solar and wind power have been been hailed as a sustainable way to meet the energy needs of the future. 
        </p>
        <p> The energy story of the past three decades does demonstrate a sustained move away from the worst pollutants. But rhetoric aside, the United States requires much more sustained investment in renewable energy before these power sources can fully substitute for fossil fuels.

          <p class="steptitle">Energy in 1990</p>
          <p>In 1990, the US energy landscape was dominated by coal, which generated over 1.5 billion megawatt hours of power.</p>
          <p>Nuclear energy, the second largest source of energy, generated less than half the power generated by coal.</p>
          <p>Hydroelectric and geothermal power contributed modestly to the power landscape, while solar and wind power were almost non-existent.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step" data-step="2">
          <p class="steptitle">Energy in 2019</p>
          <p>By 2019, the energy landscape had shifted dramatically. </p>
          <p> Natural gas power more than tripled, generating as much energy as coal did in 1990, while coal generation decreased by over a third.</p>
          <p> Wind and solar power also appear non-trivially in the landscape.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step" data-step="3">
          <p class="steptitle">Coal: On the Decline</p>
          <p>While coal generation decreased, its decline was far from steady.</p>
          <p>Instead, coal energy generation climbed through the mid 2000s, then fell to less than half its peak of over 2 billion megawatt hours generated.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step" data-step="4">
          <p class="steptitle">Petroleum: Fading Out</p>
          <p>By contrast, power generation by petroleum was more volatile through the mid 2000s, with significant peaks and valleys around an average of approximately 100 million megawatt hours.</p>
          <p>However, by 2019, petroleum was generating less than one sixth of its 1990 levels of power. 
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="step" data-step="5">
          <p class="steptitle">Natural Gas: A Story of Growth</p>
          <p>Natural gas showed the greatest increase of all energy sources over the past three decades.</p>
          <p>Its growth has been steady - almost quadrupling from its 1990 production of about 400 million megawatt hours, to generate nearly 1.6 billion megawatt hours of energy in 2019.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step" data-step="6">
          <p class="steptitle">Geo and Hydro Hold Steady</p>
          <p>Geothermal and hydroelectric power have held fairly constant since 1990.</p>
          <p>While the United States has experienced volatility in hydroelectric power generation, with a nearly 200 million megawatt hour swing between its highest and lowest points, the average has remained steady, around 300 million megawatt hours of total generation.</p>
          <p>Geothermal energy, meanwhile, has remained both stable and limited since 1990. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="step" data-step="7">
          <p class="steptitle">Nuclear: Modest Increases</p>
          <p>Nuclear energy, which is classified as a renewable source of energy - but comes with safety and waste management concerns - grew modestly over the past 30 years, adding a third to its 1990 levels.</p>
          <p>The growth in nuclear energy slowed to a crawl in the 2010s, perhaps indicating a shift away from new nuclear plants.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step" data-step="8">
          <p class="steptitle">Wind: Rapid Growth</p>
          <p>The largest increase in renewable power comes from wind energy.</p>
          <p>From near non-existence in 1990, wind power grew slowly through the mid 2000s, when it picked up momentum.</p>
          <p>Once wind power started to grow, it grew quickly - in the last 15 years, wind power generation increased by over a factor of 10.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step" data-step="9">
          <p class="steptitle">Solar: Recent Rapid Change</p>
          <p>Solar power generation is a relative recent development.</p>
          <p>Solar energy levels were near-zero through the early 2010s, before picking up quickly in the last decade.</p>
          <p>By 2019, solar power generation had reached nearly 70 million megawatt hours - and growth does not appear to be slowing.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step" data-step="10">
          <p class="steptitle">Dirty vs Clean</p>
          <p>However, wind and solar both require much greater investment to begin generating power at the levels of the 'dirtier' power sources: coal, gas, and nuclear.</p>
          <p>By 2019, wind power had only just overtaken hydroelectric power generation, while solar power still makes up a small share of total energy production.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step" data-step="11">
          <p class="steptitle">Renewable Energy is Growing</p>
          <p>The last three decades of power generation in the United States has been characterized by persistant growth in renewable energy, which has nearly doubled since 1990.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step" data-step="12">
          <p class="steptitle">An Ongoing Challenge</p>
          <p>The final energy picture is mixed.</p>
          <p>Mostly due to the significant growth in natural gas generation, non-renewable energy has also grown during the same time period.</p>
          <p>It is promising, however, that while renewable energy is trending upwards, nonrenewable energy has been trending downwards since the late 2000s.</p>
          <p>If this trend continues, we may yet reach a future in which renewable sources of power generate more of our energy than nonrenewables.</p>

        <h2>Explore Energy Generation in America</h2>
        <p>
          Perhaps predictably, in America, the conversation about pollution and power is deeply politicized: democrats push for stronger regulations on carbon emissions and bans on oil exploration, while republicans claim that a move away from fossil fuels will cause catatrophic economic consequences. Federal administrations from opposing parties take turns undoing each othersâ€™ executive orders, and the polarization in Congress makes legislation unlikely. Given the consequences of continued deadlock and inaction - more frequent and more devastating natural disasters, species extinction, displacement, health impacts - is there a path towards a more renewable future that can pass political muster?
        </p>
        <p>
          Based on trends in power generation in America, renewable energy is a bipartisan policy reality. States increased their green energy generation almost uniformly, and began to move away from the worst pollutants. Rust Belt states along the Great Lakes are showing large decreases in coal generation, while some states in the Great Plains are generating more of their power from wind than from coal. Texas, a fossil fuels giant, is the single largest producer of wind energy, with wind power generation nearing the levels of coal in the state. And states in the Southwest are taking advantage of technological advancements to invest in solar energy.
