      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Energy generation has changed significantly over the past thirty years. Fossil fuels face a public relations disaster because the carbon dioxide emissions they produce are driving catatrophic global climate change. Meanwhile, renewable energy sources like solar and wind power have been been hailed as the way of the future.</p>
      <p>
        Perhaps predictably, in America, the conversation about pollution and power is deeply politicized: democrats push for stronger regulations on carbon emissions and bans on oil exploration, while republicans claim that a move away from fossil fuels will cause catatrophic economic consequences. Federal administrations from opposing parties take turns undoing each othersâ€™ executive orders, and the polarization in Congress makes legislation unlikely. Given the consequences of continued deadlock and inaction - more frequent and more devastating natural disasters, species extinction, displacement, health impacts - is there a path towards a more renewable future that can pass political muster?

      <p>
        Based on trends in power generation in America, renewable energy is a bipartisan policy reality. States increased their green energy generation almost uniformly, and began to move away from the worst pollutants. However, the growth in renewable energy generation has not meant universal decreases in emissions. Many states that have increased their renewable generation have also increased their nonrenewable generation - and their emissions along with it. Yet Rust Belt states along the Great Lakes are showing the largest descrease in emissions, and the growth in emissions has slowed in high non-renewable production states like Texas.
